# 🃏 RIDE THE BUS

Ride the Bus is a browser-based version of the classic card game. Test your luck as you guess your way through a gauntlet of cards. This digital edition captures the unpredictable chaos of the original game.

## 🎮 Game description

**Ride the Bus** is played in four increasingly tricky rounds where players must correctly guess the outcome of card draws based on limited information.

Rounds include:

1. **Red or Black** – Guess the colour of the card.

1. **Higher or Lower** – Will the next card be higher or lower than the last?

3. **Inside or Outside** – Will the card value fall inside or outside the previous two cards?

4. **Suit Guess** – Pick the correct suit.
